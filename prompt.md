- we are creating a mock up project for https://www.expedia.com/Flights 
- we are using MySql database
- And for any edits or queries to the database we want to use stored procedures 
- For the front end we are using html java and css (and bootstrap styling)
- for we are using php to handle db connection but entries we are using stored procedure for any query or any changes
- we are using xampp localhost for the moment
- it is a school project
- you can edit or give me a copiable text of the updated .sql file to make sure the project works well
- we might need data to populate the database
